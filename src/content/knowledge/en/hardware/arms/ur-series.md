## Key Significance

> **"The pioneer who changed the paradigm of industrial automation by developing the world's first commercial collaborative robot"**

### 1. Commercialization of the Cobot Concept

Universal Robots was the first to commercialize the **collaborative robot (Cobot)** concept, where humans and robots can safely collaborate in the same space. Unlike traditional industrial robots that had to operate only within safety fences, UR robots can operate in most applications without safety barriers through force limiting and collision detection features.

### 2. Democratization of Programming

The intuitive **PolyScope** graphical interface and 12-inch touchscreen dramatically lowered the barrier to robot programming. General workers can quickly set up and redeploy robots without specialized robot engineers.

### 3. Ecosystem Building

Through the **UR+ Ecosystem**, they built a platform where third-party developers can develop and sell compatible products (grippers, sensors, software). This ensures compatibility with various end-effectors and expands the range of applications.

### 4. Formation of the Danish Robotics Cluster

Universal Robots' success contributed to the formation of a robotics cluster centered on Odense, Denmark. Currently, there are over 400 robot companies in Denmark with total revenues exceeding $2.8 billion.

### e-Series Model Details (UR3e, UR5e, UR10e, UR16e)

#### UR3e - Tabletop Precision Work
The compact yet powerful UR3e supports 360-degree rotation on all wrist joints and infinite rotation on the end joint. Optimized for high-precision assembly, screw fastening, and lightweight part handling.

#### UR5e - General-Purpose Cobot
The mid-sized UR5e offers excellent balance of size and power, making it the most versatile for various applications. Fast setup and easy programming make it ideal for high-mix, low-volume production.

#### UR10e - Large Workspace
With 1300mm reach, suitable for heavy work requiring large workspace such as palletizing, machine tending, and welding.

#### UR16e - High Payload Compact
Provides high 16kg payload within a small footprint. Ideal for heavy machine tending, material handling, packaging, and bolt/nut fastening.

### Next-Generation Series (UR20, UR30)

Starting in 2022, Universal Robots began releasing next-generation models with completely new joint designs. These models share the e-Series software platform but have fundamentally different hardware architecture.

#### UR20 - Next-Gen Flagship
Completely new joint design enables faster cycle times and heavier load handling. 1750mm reach designed to cover the full height of standard Euro pallets.

#### UR30 - Maximum Payload
Based on UR20 architecture, provides excellent motion control and lift capacity. Used for various heavy work including palletizing, machine tending, dispensing, quality inspection, and welding.

## Safety Features and Certifications

### Safety Certifications

| Certification | Content |
|---------------|---------|
| TÜV NORD | ISO 10218-1 certified |
| ISO 13849-1 | Category 3, Performance Level d (PLd) |
| ISO/TS 15066 | Collaborative robot technical specification compliance |

### Patented Safety System

Universal Robots' patented safety system provides **8 adjustable safety functions**:

1. **Joint Position** - Set allowable position range for each joint
2. **Joint Speed** - Limit maximum speed for each joint
3. **TCP Position** - Limit Tool Center Point work area
4. **TCP Orientation** - Limit tool direction
5. **TCP Speed** - Limit tool movement speed
6. **TCP Force** - Limit maximum force on contact
7. **Momentum** - Limit robot momentum
8. **Power** - Limit total power consumption

### Force Limiting and Collision Detection

- Transmits **less than 150N** force on collision, enabling operation without safety barriers in most applications
- Complies with ISO/TS 15066-based allowable force/pressure standards per body part
- Designed referencing charts developed at University of Mainz

### ISO/TS 15066 Contribution

**Lasse Kieffer**, Universal Robots' Global Compliance Officer, participated in the ISO committee that wrote the ISO/TS 15066 specification. This specification defines force, pressure, and speed limits for collaborative robot applications and four safe interaction methods:

1. **Power and Force Limiting**
2. **Speed and Separation Monitoring**
3. **Hand-guiding**
4. **Safety-rated Stop**

> Note: ISO/TS 15066 has been integrated into ISO 10218-2:2025, changing from "cobot" to "collaborative applications" terminology to emphasize safety based on usage rather than the robot itself.
