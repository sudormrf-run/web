## Key Significance

Sanctuary AI Phoenix is a humanoid representing the **Cognitive Architecture** centered approach. While most competitors focus on end-to-end learning or imitation learning, Sanctuary AI implements **explainable and auditable** robot intelligence through the Carbon platform that mimics the cognitive system of the human brain. With telepresence-based learning, new task automation is possible within 24 hours[^2], and they are actively entering automotive manufacturing through partnership with Magna.

[^2]: Based on TechCrunch 2024.04 report. Applicable from Gen 7 onwards.
