## Key Ideas

### Voyager (2023)
```
Core: LLM writes code to autonomously explore Minecraft

Components:
1. Automatic Curriculum - LLM proposes next goals
2. Skill Library - Store/reuse discovered skills
3. Iterative Prompting - LLM fixes code on failure

Results:
- Crafted diamond tools without human intervention
- 3.3x faster skill acquisition than previous methods
```

**Impact:**
- Pioneered LLM + game agent research
- Set direction for LLM utilization in Embodied AI

### GR00T (2024)
```
Core: General-purpose foundation model for humanoid robots

Architecture:
- Dual-system (System 1 + System 2)
- VLM + Diffusion Transformer
- Large-scale synthetic data utilization

Features:
- Natural language understanding
- Human motion imitation
- Support for various humanoids
```

**Impact:**
- First open humanoid foundation model (N1)
- Core of NVIDIA's robotics ecosystem

## GEAR Lab Vision

### Foundation Agent
```
Goal: One agent performing various tasks in various environments

Games (Minecraft) -> Simulation (Isaac) -> Real Robots

Key:
- Leverage LLM reasoning capabilities
- Large-scale training in simulation
- Support for various embodiments
```

### Integration with NVIDIA Strategy
- Isaac Sim: Simulation environment
- Omniverse: Synthetic data generation
- Jetson: Edge computing
- GR00T: Foundation model
