## Key Ideas

### Dense Object Nets (2018)
```
Core: Learning consistent descriptors for every pixel on objects

Features:
- Invariant to viewpoint changes
- Correspondence between object instances
- Self-supervised learning

Applications:
- Robot grasping
- Object rearrangement
- Manipulation tasks
```

**Impact:**
- Core research in robot visual representation learning
- Influenced Transporter Networks and others
- Dense correspondence application to robotics

### Implicit Representations for Robotics
```
Core: Utilizing implicit representations like NeRF for robot manipulation

Advantages:
- Continuous 3D representation
- Novel view synthesis
- Physical interaction prediction
```
