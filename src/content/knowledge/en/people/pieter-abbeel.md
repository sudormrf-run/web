## Key Ideas

### Inverse Reinforcement Learning (2004)
```
Core: Learning reward function R from expert demonstrations

Traditional RL: R -> pi (reward -> policy)
IRL: pi* -> R (expert policy -> infer reward)
```

**Impact:**
- Robot learns "why" to behave a certain way
- Theoretical foundation for imitation learning

### Domain Randomization (2017)
```
Core: Train by randomly varying physics/visual parameters in simulation

Simulation (various conditions) -> Real robot (zero-shot transfer)
```

**Impact:**
- Core technique for sim-to-real transfer
- Used in most robot simulation training today
