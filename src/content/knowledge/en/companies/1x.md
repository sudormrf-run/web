## World Model Approach

### Core Idea

1X automates robot evaluation through a **Learned Simulator**:

```
[Real Robot Data] ──Training──→ [World Model (Simulator)]
                                       │
                                       ▼
                               [Automated Evaluation/Testing]
                                       │
                                       ▼
                               [Policy Improvement]
```

### Advantages

| Traditional Approach | 1X World Model |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Manual testing required | Automated evaluation |
| Sim-to-Real gap | Learned from real data |
| Limited scenarios | Infinite scenario generation |

### Research & Papers

- "1X World Model" (2024): Video-based world model
- Simulator trained on real robot data
- Used for policy evaluation and planning

---

## Data Collection

### Large-Scale Demo Collection

- Operating a team of human teleoperators
- Data collection across diverse environments
- End-to-End neural network training

### Embodied Data

```
Simulation Data vs Real Data

1X Perspective: "Real data is most valuable"
              → Maximize utilization through World Model
```
