## Approach

### General-Purpose Robot Brain

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Skild Foundation Model      │
│    "Any Robot, Any Task, Anywhere"  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
          │
    ┌─────┴─────┐
    ▼           ▼
┌───────┐   ┌───────┐   ┌───────┐
│Robot A│   │Robot B│   │Robot C│
└───────┘   └───────┘   └───────┘
```

### Core Strategy

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Large-scale Simulation | Pre-training in diverse environments |
| Cross-embodiment | Support for various robot forms |
| Foundation Model | Fast adaptation to new tasks |
| General Purpose | No domain limitations |

## Simulation-Based Learning

### Data Generation

- Building large-scale simulation environments
- Generating diverse physical scenarios
- Applying Domain Randomization

### Sim-to-Real Transfer

```
[Simulation] ──Domain Randomization──→ [Robust Policy] ──Transfer──→ [Real Robot]
```

---

## Technical Features

### Self-Supervised Learning

- Utilizing large-scale unlabeled data
- Learning physics from internet videos
- Curiosity-driven exploration

### Scalable Architecture

- Applying LLM scaling laws to robotics
- More data/compute → Better performance
- Cross-robot generalization

## Roadmap

| Timeline | Milestone |
|----------|-----------|
| 2023 | Company founded |
| 2024.07 | $300M Series A |
| 2024-25 | Foundation Model development |
| 2025+ | Partner robot integration |

## Differentiators

### vs Physical Intelligence

| Factor | Skild AI | Physical Intelligence |
|--------|----------|----------------------|
| Background | CMU academia | Google/Stanford |
| Approach | Simulation-centric | Real data-centric |
| Funding | $300M | $400M+ |

### Simulation vs Real Data Debate

```
Skild: "Infinite data generation possible through simulation"
      + Overcome Sim-to-Real gap with Domain Randomization

Physical Intelligence: "Real physical interaction is essential"
                      + Simulation has its limitations
```
